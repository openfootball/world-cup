                "bio": "Fourteen years have passed since Russia’s No1 and captain, arguably the best-known player in the squad, made his international debut. It has been quite a ride and he will hope this summer banishes bad memories of the 2014 World Cup, when he embarrassingly fumbled Lee Keun-ho’s harmless shot into his own net against South Korea. His reputation outside Russia tends to centre on an unwanted record of 43 Champions League games without a clean sheet, which only ended last November when CSKA Moscow beat Benfica 2-0. All of this ignores his enduring quality, though. Akinfeev is stable, confident and frequently saves whole games for CSKA Moscow. If his European record is questionable, he has kept more clean sheets in Russian football than any other goalkeeper. Akinfeev also has a peculiar taste in music – he recorded a couple of songs with the Russian pop group Ruki Vverkh! (“Hands up!”). ",

Mario Fernandes, who has now lived in Russia for the past six years, boasts a similarly limited vocabulary. He’s not the first Brazilian-born player to represent Russia – Lokomotiv’s long-serving keeper Guilherme, who was in the squad at Euro 2016 squad, beat him to that accolade – but presented a welcome addition to Stanislav Cherchesov’s options when he made his debut in October 2017. That came almost exactly three years after he won his first and only Brazil cap against Japan; the match was only a friendly so he was able to switch allegiance after receiving his Russian citizenship in July 2016. “I do not think it is a loss for our national team, Brazil has a lot of strong players,” his former Gremio team-mate Gilberto Silva said.

Like Cherchesov, Dzagoev is of Caucasian descent; he was born in Beslan, North Ossetia, and his early football years were spent in Vladikavkaz. He finished Euro 2012 as the tournament’s joint-top scorer with three goals despite Russia’s group stage exit; four years later he fractured a metatarsal and had to miss Euro 2016, which was a gigantic loss for a team that was built to maximise his strengths.

He has reached double figures in each of the last three campaigns, representing sharp progress from his career up to April 2014, by which time he had managed just six goals. In January Smolov, a quick and technical striker, was a transfer target for West Ham but decided to stay in Russia with Krasnodar.

Miranchuk is primarily an attacking midfielder but last year Lokomotiv started asking him to lead the line, and nowadays he is considered a striker for the national team too. In 2015 he joined “Team Messi” – a selection of 10 young players from all over the world, chosen by the Argentinian superstar, who wore exclusive personalised boots. He says he and his brother have little interest in spending any footballing riches on extravagances, proclaiming: “There is no desire to burn money on cars.”",

He tends to play in the middle but, like Alexey, has been deployed further forward too. The primary distinctive feature between the twins, who were born in the Krasnodar region, is their weight: Anton considerably heavier than Alexey. Recently he spoke of the importance his tight-knit family has had on his career. “I always listen to the opinions of my relatives, because I know they are sincere and true,” he said. “Somewhere their words give me strength and confidence.”",

Back in 2015, Golovin was playing for CSKA’s reserves and representing Russia in age-group football at the Uefa Under-19 Championship, in which an impressive side finished runners-up. Now he occupies a significant role in both club and national teams, setting the tone for the latter in June 2015 when he scored on his senior Russia debut against Belarus just minutes after entering the pitch as a substitute. Golovin is a flexible player with a broad range of abilities: he is relentless, assertive and has a high level of passing ability.

He still has a good turn of pace and, of course, the experience gleaned from a long career whose achievements include a Premier League and FA Cup double in 2009-10, as well as a Uefa Cup with CSKA Moscow. Whenever Russia are knocked out, he will have more time to indulge in what, for a footballer, is a decidedly unusual hobby. Zhirkov enjoys collecting Second World War memorabilia and even has a Soviet limousine in his collection. In 2015 he announced plans to open a museum in an old German bunker in Kaliningrad, although it is yet to materialise. “There’s not enough room for everything I have accumulated in the bunker, anyway,” he admitted.",

It appears he made the correct choice: the experienced right-winger is – if we count the Confederations Cup – going to his fourth major tournament in a row and should start against Saudi Arabia in the opening game. He could perhaps be deployed more effectively, though: Cherchesov uses him as a wing-back, but he is an entirely attacking player and the role does not particularly suit him.

He was part of the squad that eventually reached the semi-finals, although he sat on the bench throughout while Akinfeev played.

He was expected to play at the Confederations Cup but, on the last day of the pre-tournament training, was suddenly sent home. An injury was the official reason but rumours swirled about a row with Stanislav Cherchesov.

The players were training one morning, running along a forest trail, and Saúl was leading the group.

Soon enough, any anxiety he was feeling disappeared and by April Rodrigo, who sometimes played on the wing, had scored 15 in the league and 20 in total for club and country.

In response, the player who grew up in Aramon in the south of France said he had crossed a line. \"I'm a Muslim, what is the connection? I am what? A terrorist?

I would have ended up spending a great deal of time on the bench as Liverpool were only looking to fill a void for part of their season. I want to move to a big club to develop and therefore I will time the move with great precision. I’m sure I will be playing for a top European club in the near future.”",

Mbappé’s was invited to meet the Liberian president George Weah and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in February to discuss the future of African sport: an indication of how highly regarded he has become, despite not turning 20 until December. “If I can use my fame and projects to help African sport develop then I'll do it with great pleasure,” he said.

The 34-year-old was given a 12-month doping ban last year after testing positive for cocaine, which he said was consumed by mistake in contaminated tea. The ban was halved on appeal - but then the World Anti Doping Agency appealed, seeking an extension. As a result, his World Cup participation was in the balance until the end of May, when he was finally cleared to take part. In 2016, the biopic “Guerrero” had the biggest opening of any film in Peru, with half a million viewers in its first week alone - and before the World Cup he had a message for his public: “All the affection that comes my way from Peruvians is priceless, children write to me, pray for me - I cannot find the words to express my thanks. I will do everything I can to bring joy to Peru.”",

It would have been strange, just like asking an Englishman to represent another country.” Stine, his wife, said in an interview that meeting a 17-year-old Kasper set off “fireworks” but that life as footballer’s wife isn’t as glamorous as people think. “We’re still at home in our dungarees, picking up Lego from the floor and making packed lunches,” she told Alt last year.

I can imagine they did that because it sends out the wrong signals, that there’s no humility in doing that, so the players with Ferraris and Lamborghinis have to leave them at home.”  One thing he didn’t like, however, was the shirt. “Lotto had made them and the material was terrible.

Paul Pogba won that year and the two players have had slightly different journeys since. Fischer struggled at Middlesbrough and Mainz but now, back at Copenhagen, he has rediscovered his form, and could be a surprise at the World Cup with his pace and opportunism. When he was 11, and Barcelona played AGF in a friendly, he held Ronaldinho’s hand as the two teams walked onto the pitch. He was later given the Brazilian’s shirt. ",

Soon after leaving he criticised the board and life in general, adding: “There’s not much tactical work in England, and when you go out in London nobody knows who you are.” If life had gone differently, he’d be a doctor now. “I was a medical student for 18 months,” he said, “but then I went to play for Sevilla when I was 19. Do I regret giving up medicine? No. Life in football has been amazing.”",

Valencia said: \"We want no more off-field shame.\" Soon after that he was run over by his own car having forgotten to put the handbrake on at a petrol station, resulting in a broken leg. He has settled down since, but is still capable of unpredictable moments, such as being sent off for abusing a referee in his first game back in his second spell at Sevilla last year. This summer he’ll be looking to make a positive statement, having been one of three players excluded from Alejandro Sabella’s final 23-man squad in 2014.

He’s sanguine about it, though. “That’s what happens to people who are strong at what they do, right?” he told the Guardian last year. “Everyone gets used to seeing you score lots of goals, and then when you don’t score for two games they get surprised. That’s actually a rather beautiful thing, it’s cute.” His ambition for this summer is clear enough. “I want to leave my name at the highest level of this sport.

But now I’m dreaming again of being in a World Cup final, of lifting the cup. It's a dream I've always had. Every time a World Cup comes along, that feeling only becomes stronger.

He made a good impression, and since then the 22-year-old PSG midfielder has been a regular in Argentina squads. His adaptability, intelligence and composure since he signed for PSG from Rosario Central in 2016 has earned plenty of praise. He says: “It’s a privilege to be surrounded by players such as Messi with Argentina and Neymar with PSG. I like to see their movements on the pitch, and I keep learning from them. Honestly, I couldn’t have imagined all this a while ago.” The then-PSG coach Unai Emery said in January: “He’s won the right to be in my team. First he won the respect of his team-mates, then of the coach and then of the fans. This is a very important player.” ",

I will just have to adapt to him.” Messi agreed: “We’ve spoken about it, and it’s true. We try and use the same spaces.” Dybala’s raw talent, though, secured him a place in Russia, and he’s a potentially potent option, even though Jorge Sampaoli has also expressed his reservations in public, saying: “It’s hard to get him used to our system.” When Dybala isn’t being called La Joya he has another nickname, too. “I call him ‘Square R2’,” said his former team-mate Paul Pogba last year. “That’s the key combination you press on PlayStation to do a turn and shot.

I’ve progressed little by little, thanks to the help of my colleagues.” His first taste of international football was tense: “I got nervous when Messi greeted me. I didn’t dare ask for a picture, but I just enjoyed watching him train.” He also had to hold his nerve last year when an old video emerged of him talking about his love for Boca’s rivals River Plate, saying: “At home we have River pillows, River sheets, River everything.” He explained: “That is all in the past. I prefer not to talk about this topic.”",

He impressed in that, but then took a hefty step backwards by letting in five a few days later against Spain after coming off the bench. At club level he had plenty of options after leaving Manchester City, but opted to be back-up to Thibaut Courtois at Chelsea. “Some find that uncomfortable, but for me, to compete with the best makes me stronger.” He became a goalkeeper aged six after discovering “I enjoy giving out orders and correcting people.” If a game goes to penalties, keep an eye on him.

He’s closing in on 100 caps and has long been one of Croatia’s key players, despite the fact that no manager – and he has seen a few in his time – has been able to resolve the Modric-Rakitic conundrum of how best to use both playmakers together.

We didn’t always have what we wanted or needed, we had to struggle”, Ighalo told The Guardian. He now strives to improve others’ lives, often assisting charitable causes.

He made his debut for Crystal Palace, then in the Championship, aged 16 and represented England through to under-21 level before committing to Nigeria. A softly-spoken, shy individual, he was feted for his pace, trickery and flamboyance as a winger but has traded some of those traits for solidity, tackling and defensive awareness since becoming a wing-back at Chelsea. That mercurial spark returns when he pulls on the Super Eagles jersey, though: Moses is a creative force for his country, full of running and inventive moves to burst past the defensive line. He is considered by fans to be a maverick capable of turning a game on its head, and his form will have a big bearing on Nigeria’s prospects in Russia. It’s a far cry from his early days in Nigeria, where he started out playing street football. \"No boots, just in your bare feet, a little ball got chucked in and we started playing,” he told the Guardian in 2012.",

Fortunately, with qualification already assured, it was more embarrassing than damaging. Abdullahi plays as a defensive midfielder for his club side, Bursaspor, but has been viewed by Gernot Rohr as the solution to Nigeria’s right-back problem. Before moving to Turkey in January he had spent his career in Cyprus, Portugal, Kuwait and back home with Kano Pillars. He believes the friendly win over Argentina makes Nigeria favourites when the pair meet again, and thinks Iceland are their most dangerous group stage opponents. “They are a physical side with collective effort, he told the New Telegraph after the draw.",

Going through that experience I learnt a lot about myself. It taught me so much, especially about my mental strength, and I think that is what prepared me for the latter years. Now I can control my emotions and be strong even when things aren't going so well.” Asked to identify his best ever goal, he replied: “My wife is the best goal I ever scored.

City inserted a buy-back clause of £50m after he was deemed surplus to requirements by Pep Guardiola, but it’s not an option they seem likely to pursue as things stand.

A chance to rediscover that form arrived in the friendly against Argentina but Akpeyi threw it away with a horrible blunder, picking the ball up at Sergio Agüero’s feet outside the area. Worse still, his poor positioning at the resulting free-kick gave Ever Banega a relatively simple finish into the far corner. Akpeyi claimed afterwards that he thought an offside had been given as Agüero bore down on him; either way, the mistake has pushed him further down the pecking order and although Gernot Rohr has backed him, it would be a surprise to see him heavily involved in Russia.",

But the qualities that attracted the Premier League club endure: he defends on the front foot, nipping ahead of strikers to intercept passes, and remains a solid option to step in at centre-back when called upon.",

He played once more before he returned to Fabril, Deportivo’s B side, but those outings were enough to earn his first call-up, and he came on in the second half of the 4-2 victory over Argentina the following month. His shot-stopping ability was clear in the March friendly against Poland, where he overcame an uncertain start to produce two world-class saves and earn a clean sheet. Gernot Rohr has referred to him as the future of the team but says he could be the main pick in Russia, too. “I won’t be afraid to start him in our opening game,” he said.

His former Porto manager Julen Lopetegui told the Guardian about the defensive midfielder’s qualities in 2016: “He’s strong in the challenge, of 10 challenges he wins nine, he’s intense, he has character, he is very conscious of his limitations and his qualities. Centre-backs adore him. In a team that attacks a lot - one that looks to play in the opposition’s half and has a lot of players in front of the ball - he’s a basic need.” Lopetegui’s fitness coach described him as “an octopus”.

There’s still plenty of competition for places in midfield, though. “I know my importance within the group,” he said in April, “so I just have to keep fit, train well and be ready to play if Tite needs me.

Much has changed in my life: Paris brought me many beautiful things. It’s a magical city, a city of love.” He made his senior Brazil debut in 2013, and captained the side for the first time last year in a 3-0 win over Chile in his hometown São Paulo.

But he went to Ivory Coast and he had this thing with my biological mother, Angeline, so that's where I came from. Danielle could not have kids and my father said to her: 'Look, I had this thing … my son was born, I made a mistake,' and she just said to him: 'Let's bring him here and we can adopt him.' My dad was in contact with my natural mother. So at the age of 18 months, I moved from Abidjan to Geneva.”",

It’s nearly perfect.” Generally considered a reserved character, he surprised some in March by laying in to his international colleagues after their 1-0 loss to Brazil, saying: “We have shown that were are not as good as some of us might think.

He had an uneasy start to life with Barcelona after signing in 2014, but grew into it and is now embraced on and off the pitch. He speaks Catalan and Spanish, and has been spotted a few times riding his electric scooter through Gràcia, the hip part of town, on his way to an artisan bakery. In March he spoke out against the official Russia 2018 World Cup ball, attacking its unpredictability in the air: “It moves so much. It could be a lot better.” Argentina World Cup legend Ubaldo Fillol responded by telling him to get used to it. “Fifa have done this for years, they always want keepers on the back foot. Keepers grumble that life is harder and harder for them, but they stand between football and goals. And what both fans and Fifa want is goals.”",

Before you kick the ball, you feel like you're 200 kilos – then it leaves your foot, goes through the air and ripples the net.

Yet given the laid-back guy that he is, Dembele, who has won 70 caps since making his international debut as a teenager in 2006, never lets the fact that he is not guaranteed a starting spot under Roberto Martínez get under his skin. Out of contract in a year, he could be on the move this summer.",

He was a keen boxer when he was growing up and says roughing it with bigger opponents helped him get over his “little-man syndrome”.",

At Euro 2016, after a hectic club season when he had won Bundesliga, German Cup and made the Champions League semi-final, he was a little too tired.

The following season he was a regular in a side that won the Polish championship. He’s not shy. In 2015 he made a bet with fans on Twitter, saying he’d pay a lump sum to charity if he didn’t score at least 10 goals after the winter break. He failed to do so and duly paid for medical treatment for his former coach's daughter. He moved to Serie A in the summer of 2017 and is slowly making a name for himself. He captains of Poland's U-21 team. ",

Since then he has struggled with various injuries, but put those problems behind him to play at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016. His excellent performances in the J-League earned him a full international debut last December. Nakamura’s hero as a boy was Oliver Kahn.",
